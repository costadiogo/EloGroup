### Installing


A step by step that will guide you on how to run the project on your computer.


Clone the project repository:

Go to the project directory:

```

### Start without Docker


In your terminal type:

After installing the dependencies we will start the server

### Start with Docker

If everything has worked out so far in your terminal the following command will appear:

Starting mongodb ... done
server-api is up-to-date
```

## Testing the frontend application
```
> cd client
```

In your terminal type:

```
